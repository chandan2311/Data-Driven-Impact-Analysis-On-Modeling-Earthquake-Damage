# Data-Driven-Impact-Analysis-On-Modeling-Earthquake-Damage
This study aims to analyze a dataset containing information on buildings impacted by the Gorkha earthquake in a specific region. The goal is to identify key factors influencing building vulnerability, including age, floor count, area, height, roof type, foundation, and superstructure materials. By examining geographic location, land surface condition, legal ownership, and secondary uses, the study seeks to understand their relationship with building resilience. The findings will inform policymakers and urban planners on effective earthquake risk mitigation strategies, improving building codes, construction practices, and disaster response efforts to create safer communities in earthquake-prone areas.
